#Next Steps:
""" Next we will add a function that displays a set of instructions for using
   this program to the user. Check out the comment within the 'Functions Go
   Here' section.
   """


#----> Functions Go Here:

# showTitle() - Displays the title
def showTitle():
    print("**********Lap Timer**********")
    print()

# showInstructions() - Add a new function called 'showInstructions'. Use the
# code within the triple-quoted-string for its code-block.
#--->Replace this line with the function defintion statement<---
"""    print("Press Enter to record time for each lap.")
    print("Enter 'q' after last lap is recorded.")
    """



#----> Main program starts here:

showTitle()

#--->Repalce this with a call to showInstructions<---

#WHAT THIS SHOULD DO: At this point it should print out the title and the
#   instructions.

#NEXT STEP --> Open the file '03_GoodTime.py' and follow its instrctions.
