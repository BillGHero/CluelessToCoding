	<ol>
		<li><p> <b>d</b><b>ata</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> –
		</span><span style="font-weight: normal">Has many meanings. But it
		can be generally thought of as both a collection of details and
		each individual detail. Such details can be numeric: like the
		amount of money in a bank account, textual: such as the title of a
		book, or any of many other possible details which describe
		something.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>memory</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> –
		</span><span style="font-weight: normal">Typically used to refer to
		the Random Access Memory (RAM) that most computers possess. RAM is
		normally volatile – that is its contents is lost when a machine
		is turned off. It can help to know that while most veteran
		programmers usually use the word ‘memory’ when talking about
		the volatile sotrage some people also use it to refer to
		non-volatile storage like hard drives and solid state drives.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>abstract</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> – </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Or
		‘Abstraction’; refers to the practice of </span><span style="font-weight: normal">hiding
		the details of exactly how something is accomplished so that a
		programmer only needs to concentrate on the details that are
		directly relevant to to the program being written. In the case of
		variables, many programming languages allow the programmer to
		concentrate on the type of data and its lifespan without having to
		worry about the hardware it is stored in or its location.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>variable</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> – </span><span style="font-weight: normal">A
		common mechanism that is available in many programming languages
		which allows for storage of data for later use. The variable can be
		thought of as a method which can ‘abstract’ the use of machine
		storage by a program from all the messy details that would
		otherwise need to be accounted for.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>label</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> –
		</span><span style="font-weight: normal">Programmers often find
		themselves deciding on names for the components of the software
		they design. These names are sometimes referred to as ‘labels’.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>assignment statement</b> <b>/ assignment operator</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
		– </span><span style="font-weight: normal">An assignment
		statement is a statement within a program which assigns some data
		or other value to a variable. The assignment operator is usually
		the equal sine ( ‘=’ ).</span></p>
		<li><p style="font-weight: normal"> <b>statement</b> – Any
		discrete piece of a program which contains enough infromation to be
		executed in and of itself. Usually statements occupy a single line
		of a program, although this is not always the case.</p>
		<li><p> <b>literal</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> – </span><span style="font-weight: normal">When
		data is contained directly within the source code of a program the
		text which represents the actual value is called a literal. </span>
		</p>
		<li><p> <b>operator</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> –
		</span><span style="font-weight: normal">Operators are used to
		direct some kind of action. ‘+ - * / %’ are the addition,
		subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operators
		respectively. The equal sign is usually used as the ‘assignment
		operator’.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>interpreter</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> –
		</span><span style="font-weight: normal">There are several
		different processes available to take the source code a person
		writes and translate it into actions executed by a computer. For
		Python this is usually done through another program called an
		‘interpreter’. Python’s interpreter takes the scripts (which
		are the standard form of ‘source code’ for Python) and it
		‘interprets’ them into a virtual machine code. This virtual
		machine code is then executed by a Python virtual machine. Some
		other programming languages which use a virtual machine include
		Java, C#, and Ruby.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>state of a variable</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
		– </span><span style="font-weight: normal">A variable’s state
		is usually the value it contains or points to. Some languages also
		recognize special states for variables which are independent of the
		dta typically contained or pointed to by them. One such state that
		Python recognizes is ‘</span><span style="font-weight: normal">None’,
		which means a truly empty variable as opposed to the value of zero.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>expression</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> –
		</span><span style="font-weight: normal">Generally, any statement
		which can evaluate to a value. This includes mathematical
		</span><span style="font-weight: normal">expressions.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>data type</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> – </span><span style="font-weight: normal">The
		form of informational details. Some of the data types available in
		Python include float, long-integer, short-integer, and string
		types.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>integer</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> – </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Any
		whole number. It can be either positive or negative. S</span><span style="font-weight: normal">ome
		programming languages recognize more than one type of integer,
		usually differentiated by the amount of memory space they require.
		Python has no hard limit as to the size of the whole number its
		integers can represent.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>float</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> – </span><span style="font-weight: normal">A
		number which includes a ‘fractional’ or ‘less-than one’
		portion. here 1 ½ is equivalent to 1.5 .</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>string</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> – </span><span style="font-weight: normal">A
		collection of letters, number, punctuation symbols and similar.
		When thinking of a string it helps to consider them to be similar
		to a collection of characters that are ‘strung’ together.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>built-in function</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
		– </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Functions can be
		thought of as mini-programs, or sub-programs. They can be ‘called’,
		sent input data, and often ‘return’ some data or value. A call
		to a function includes the name of the function followed by a pair
		of parenthesis containing whatever data is to be sent to the
		function.</span></p>
		<li><p> <b>arguments</b> / <b>parameters</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
		– </span><span style="font-weight: normal">The data and/or values
		</span><span style="font-weight: normal">sent to a function.</span></p>

			<li><p><b>+ - * /</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> % -
			mathematical operators (note that *, /, </span><span style="font-weight: normal">and
