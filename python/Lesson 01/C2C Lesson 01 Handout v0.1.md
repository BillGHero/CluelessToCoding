**Lesson 1 Handout v0.1**

1.  Terminology

    1.   **data** – Has many meanings. But it can be generally thought
        of as both a collection of details and each individual detail.
        Such details can be numeric: like the amount of money in a bank
        account, textual: such as the title of a book, or any of many
        other possible details which describe something.
    2.   **memory** – Typically used to refer to the Random Access
        Memory (RAM) that most computers possess. RAM is normally
        volatile – that is its contents is lost when a machine is turned
        off. It can help to know that while most veteran programmers
        usually use the word ‘memory’ when talking about the volatile
        sotrage some people also use it to refer to non-volatile storage
        like hard drives and solid state drives.
    3.   **abstract** – Or ‘Abstraction’; refers to the practice of
        hiding the details of exactly how something is accomplished so
        that a programmer only needs to concentrate on the details that
        are directly relevant to to the program being written. In the
        case of variables, many programming languages allow the
        programmer to concentrate on the type of data and its lifespan
        without having to worry about the hardware it is stored in or
        its location.
    4.   **variable** – A common mechanism that is available in many
        programming languages which allows for storage of data for later
        use. The variable can be thought of as a method which can
        ‘abstract’ the use of machine storage by a program from all the
        messy details that would otherwise need to be accounted for.
    5.   **label** – Programmers often find themselves deciding on names
        for the components of the software they design. These names are
        sometimes referred to as ‘labels’.
    6.  ** assignment statement** **/ assignment operator** – An
        assignment statement is a statement within a program which
        assigns some data or other value to a variable. The assignment
        operator is usually the equal sine ( ‘=’ ).
    7.   **statement** – Any discrete piece of a program which contains
        enough infromation to be executed in and of itself. Usually
        statements occupy a single line of a program, although this is
        not always the case.
    8.   **literal** – When data is contained directly within the source
        code of a program the text which represents the actual value is
        called a literal.
    9.   **operator** – Operators are used to direct some kind of
        action. ‘+ - \* / %’ are the addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, division, and modulus operators respectively.
        The equal sign is usually used as the ‘assignment operator’.
    10.  **interpreter** – There are several different processes
        available to take the source code a person writes and translate
        it into actions executed by a computer. For Python this is
        usually done through another program called an ‘interpreter’.
        Python’s interpreter takes the scripts (which are the standard
        form of ‘source code’ for Python) and it ‘interprets’ them into
        a virtual machine code. This virtual machine code is then
        executed by a Python virtual machine. Some other programming
        languages which use a virtual machine include Java, C\#, and
        Ruby.
    11.  **state of a variable** – A variable’s state is usually the
        value it contains or points to. Some languages also recognize
        special states for variables which are independent of the dta
        typically contained or pointed to by them. One such state that
        Python recognizes is ‘None’, which means a truly empty variable
        as opposed to the value of zero.
    12.  **expression** – Generally, any statement which can evaluate to
        a value. This includes mathematical expressions.
    13.  **data type** – The form of informational details. Some of the
        data types available in Python include float, long-integer,
        short-integer, and string types.
    14.  **integer** – Any whole number. It can be either positive or
        negative. Some programming languages recognize more than one
        type of integer, usually differentiated by the amount of memory
        space they require. Python has no hard limit as to the size of
        the whole number its integers can represent.
    15.  **float** – A number which includes a ‘fractional’ or
        ‘less-than one’ portion. here 1 ½ is equivalent to 1.5 .
    16.  **string** – A collection of letters, number, punctuation
        symbols and similar. When thinking of a string it helps to
        consider them to be similar to a collection of characters that
        are ‘strung’ together.
    17.  **built-in function** – Functions can be thought of as
        mini-programs, or sub-programs. They can be ‘called’, sent input
        data, and often ‘return’ some data or value. A call to a
        function includes the name of the function followed by a pair of
        parenthesis containing whatever data is to be sent to the
        function.
    18.  **arguments** / **parameters** – The data and/or values sent to
        a function.

2.  Programming Elements

    1.   Operators:

        1.  = - the equal sign causes a value on the right to be
            ‘assigned’ to the variable on the right.
        2.  + - \* / % - mathematical operators (note that \*, /, and %
            are multiply, divide, and modulus respectively)

    2.  Python Keywords:

    3.  Python Functions:

        1.  ** print(***list of arguments***)** - built-in function that
            prints out whatever data is passed to it as parameter(s).
